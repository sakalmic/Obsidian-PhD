# Breakdown Voltage Is a Probability Distribution Not a Constant

## Core atomic concept

For a fixed configuration, breakdown voltage varies because seed availability, surface state, gas conditions and microscopic field enhancement vary. $U_{50}$ is the voltage at which the specified procedure predicts 50% breakdown probability; it is an estimand with uncertainty, not a deterministic material threshold.

## Probability models

A logistic response is

$$
P(B=1\mid U)=\operatorname{logit}^{-1}[\beta_0+\beta_1U],
\qquad U_{50}=-\beta_0/\beta_1.
$$

A three-parameter Weibull voltage model is

$$
F(U)=1-\exp\left[-\left(\frac{U-U_0}{\eta}\right)^m\right],\quad U>U_0.
$$

The working coefficient

$$k=U_{app}/U_{50}$$

inherits uncertainty from $U_{50}$; treating estimated $k$ as exact understates uncertainty in comparisons.

For $x$ successes in $n$ shots, $\hat p=x/n$ needs a Wilson or exact binomial interval. In particular, $n/n$ successes do not prove $p=1$.

## Experimental consequences

- Estimate $U_{50}$ separately for geometry, polarity and major conditioning state.
- Use a staircase/up-and-down design for efficiency, but analyse its adaptive sampling correctly.
- Compare logistic, probit and Weibull forms by predictive fit; do not select Weibull by tradition alone.
- Record chronological shot order to expose drift and conditioning.
