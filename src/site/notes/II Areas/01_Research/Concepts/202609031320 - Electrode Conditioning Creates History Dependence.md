# Electrode Conditioning Creates History Dependence

## Core atomic concept

Every discharge can alter the next one through erosion, deposited material, adsorbates, local roughness and residual gas products. The shot sequence is therefore a stateful process; “identical shots” are not automatically exchangeable.

## State-space view

Let $s_i$ be an unobserved electrode/chamber state before shot $i$:

$$s_{i+1}=g(s_i,E_i,Q_i,W_i)+\omega_i,$$

$$P(B_i=1)=\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\mathbf x_i^T\beta+\gamma s_i).$$

Practical proxies include shots since cleaning, accumulated charge

$$Q_{cum}=\sum_i\int |i_i(t)|dt,$$

and accumulated action

$$A_{cum}=\sum_i\int i_i^2(t)dt.$$

These do not fully represent erosion but make history testable.

## Experimental consequences

- Photograph electrodes and record mass/roughness where feasible before and after campaigns.
- Define conditioning, cleaning and replacement protocols.
- Keep chronological shot order and include shots-since-service in plots/models.
- Interleave conditions within stable blocks; do not confound treatment with ageing.
- Repeat the key result after service or with a second electrode pair.
