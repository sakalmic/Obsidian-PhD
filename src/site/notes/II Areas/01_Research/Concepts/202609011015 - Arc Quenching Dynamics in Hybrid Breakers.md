# Arc Quenching Dynamics in Hybrid Breakers

## Core concept
In a hybrid breaker, current is commutated away from the mechanical contact into another branch so that the contact can interrupt at a natural or deliberately created current zero. Semiconductor, resonant and auxiliary-switch branches are established concepts; a laser-triggered spark gap is a **candidate auxiliary switch**, not yet a demonstrated breaker architecture in this project.

## Recovery-voltage and quenching dynamics
Arc quenching is limited by the rate of rise of recovery voltage (RRRV):
$$
\text{RRRV} = \left.\frac{du_{TRV}}{dt}\right|_{t=0} \le \left(\frac{du_{diel}}{dt}\right)_{crit}
$$
An LTSG could contribute to the timing of an auxiliary commutation pulse, but the switch alone does not create an artificial current zero. That system-level outcome additionally requires a commutation circuit, sufficient opposing current, insulation recovery and acceptable recovery-voltage stress. The core PhD campaign therefore measures trigger probability, delay, jitter, recovery and erosion first; breaker claims remain conditional on a later demonstrator.

The coupled thermal/electrical mechanism is developed in [[Arc Conductance and Recovery Compete After Current Zero\|Arc Conductance and Recovery Compete After Current Zero]]. Near current zero, a Mayr-type conductance model can be used as an identified black-box model, but its cooling power and time constant must be estimated from the specific interrupter; they are not transferable constants.

## Demonstrator evidence needed

- a complete equivalent circuit and energy balance;
- comparison with a defined incumbent auxiliary switch;
- current-zero timing and post-zero dielectric recovery;
- transient recovery voltage and RRRV margin;
- repetitive-shot lifetime, failure modes and laser-system overhead.
