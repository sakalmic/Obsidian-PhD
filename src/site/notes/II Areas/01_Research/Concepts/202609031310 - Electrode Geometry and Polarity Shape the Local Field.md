# Electrode Geometry and Polarity Shape the Local Field

## Core atomic concept

Breakdown responds to the local field and its gradient, not only to average $U/d$. Electrode curvature, edges, apertures, surface defects and polarity determine where avalanches start and how streamers propagate.

## Mathematical formulation

Before appreciable space charge,

$$\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla\phi)=0,\qquad \mathbf E=-\nabla\phi.$$

A field-enhancement factor is

$$\beta_E=\frac{E_{max}}{U/d}.$$

Once charge develops, Laplace's equation must be replaced by Poisson's equation. The relevant avalanche score along a field line is

$$K(\mathcal L)=\int_{\mathcal L}\alpha_{eff}[E(\mathbf r)/N],ds,$$

which combines geometry with gas kinetics. A geometry can have the same $U/d$ but a much larger $K$ near a sharp electrode.

## Polarity

Positive and negative streamers differ because electron drift is reversed relative to propagation and because positive propagation depends strongly on nonlocal electrons ahead of the front. Therefore polarity is an interaction term with focus position and channel topology, not just a sign convention.

## Experimental consequences

- Store CAD dimensions, tip radius, alignment tolerance, material and surface finish.
- Compute electrostatic $E/N$ maps before adding plasma chemistry.
- Determine a separate $U_{50}$ for every geometry/polarity.
- Register optical images to electrode coordinates; nominal focus position is insufficient.
- Test polarity-by-channel interactions rather than separate within-polarity significance tests.
