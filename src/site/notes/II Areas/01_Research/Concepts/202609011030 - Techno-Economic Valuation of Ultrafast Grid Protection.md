# Techno-Economic Valuation of Ultrafast Grid Protection

## Core concept
Techno-economic modelling of power-system protection translates **measured system-level changes**—for example interruption-time distribution, let-through energy, failure probability and maintenance interval—into costs and reliability outcomes. A change from $50\ \mathrm{ms}$ to $5\ \mu\mathrm{s}$ is a scenario bound, not an achieved result, until a complete demonstrator shows that the faster trigger actually shortens the system interruption sequence.

## Quantifying economic value
The total economic value $V_{tot}$ is the sum of the relevant savings:
$$
V_{tot} = \Delta C_{maint} + \Delta C_{outage} + \Delta C_{asset} - C_{laser\_sys}
$$
where:
- $\Delta C_{maint}$ is the saving in quenching-chamber maintenance cycles.
- $\Delta C_{outage}$ is the reduction in interruption costs, expressed through the value of lost load and SAIDI/SAIFI indices.
- $\Delta C_{asset}$ is the extension of transformer and switch service life through reduced dynamic short-circuit forces.
- $C_{laser\_sys}$ is the CAPEX and OPEX of the laser and optical control subsystem.

The model should propagate distributions, not only point estimates. At minimum vary trigger success, false-trigger probability, component lifetime, discount rate, maintenance cost, outage value and incumbent-switch performance. Report break-even boundaries and dominant sensitivities; calculate payback only for named use cases with traceable inputs.

For scenario $s$ with probability $p_s$ and discounted cash flow $C_{s,t}$,

$$
\operatorname{ENPV}=\sum_s p_s\sum_{t=0}^{T}\frac{C_{s,t}}{(1+r)^t}.
$$

Uncertain physical performance must enter before economic aggregation. Monte Carlo samples should preserve correlations—for example, faster interruption, lower let-through energy and longer component life may share the same underlying switching performance and must not be sampled independently without justification. Report the probability of positive NPV and break-even surfaces, not only mean NPV.
