# Plasma and External Circuit Form One Dynamical System

## Core atomic concept

After breakdown, measured voltage collapse and current rise are joint outputs of time-varying plasma impedance and the complete external circuit. They cannot be interpreted as intrinsic plasma properties without an equivalent circuit and diagnostic transfer functions.

## Mathematical formulation

For a minimal series discharge loop,

$$L\frac{di}{dt}+[R_s+R_p(t)]i+u_C=0,
\qquad C\frac{du_C}{dt}=-i.$$

The initial energy is

$$W_0=\frac12CU_0^2.$$

Useful integrated quantities are

$$Q=\int i,dt,\qquad W_p=\int u_p i,dt,
\qquad A=\int i^2dt.$$

For constant $R$, the damping ratio is

$$\zeta=\frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}},$$

but a spark plasma is nonlinear and time-varying. Fitting one constant resistance may reproduce peak current while misrepresenting early channel formation.

The recorded waveform is also filtered:

$$y_m(t)=h_m(t)*y(t)+\epsilon(t).$$

## Experimental consequences

- Draw capacitance, inductance, return path, probe loading and grounding.
- Measure or bound stray $L$ and transfer responses before inferring plasma resistance.
- Distinguish trigger delay from current rise time and circuit ringing.
- Cross-check energy conservation within uncertainty.
- Fit plasma and circuit parameters only when structurally identifiable; otherwise report equivalent quantities.
