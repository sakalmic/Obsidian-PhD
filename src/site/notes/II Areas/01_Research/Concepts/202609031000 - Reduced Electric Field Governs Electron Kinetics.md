# Reduced Electric Field Governs Electron Kinetics

## Core atomic concept

In a weakly ionised gas, the electron energy distribution and therefore ionisation, attachment, drift and diffusion are governed more directly by the **reduced electric field** $E/N$ than by electric field $E$ alone. $N=p/(k_B T_g)$ is the neutral number density. The Townsend unit is

$$1\ \mathrm{Td}=10^{-21}\ \mathrm{V\,m^2}.$$

Two experiments at different pressure or temperature are not dynamically comparable merely because they use the same voltage and gap. They are closer to electron-kinetic similarity when $E/N$, gas composition and reduced geometry are matched.

## Mathematical formulation

For an approximately uniform gap,

$$
\frac{E}{N}\approx \frac{U/d}{p/(k_B T_g)}
=\frac{U k_B T_g}{pd}.
$$

Transport and reaction coefficients are functions of the electron energy distribution $f(\varepsilon)$:

$$
\mu_e=\mu_e(E/N),\quad D_e=D_e(E/N),\quad
k_j=\int_0^\infty \sigma_j(\varepsilon)v(\varepsilon)f(\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon.
$$

Townsend similarity predicts characteristic lengths $\ell\propto N^{-1}$, charge densities $n_e\propto N^2$ and comparable velocities at fixed $E/N$, but electrode boundaries, three-body reactions, gas heating and photoionisation introduce departures.

## Experimental consequences

- Log $p$, $T_g$ and humidity for every shot block; compute $N$ rather than using nominal laboratory pressure.
- Compare polarity and geometry at matched separately measured working coefficient **and** report the simulated local $E/N$ distribution.
- A density depression $N(t)<N_0$ raises $E/N$ at unchanged applied field, providing a mechanism for delayed laser assistance.
- Use swarm/Boltzmann data for coefficients; do not fit independent arbitrary values when a defensible cross-section set exists.

## Model validity boundary

$E/N$ parameterisation assumes a local-field or local-mean-energy closure. It becomes questionable when the electron energy relaxation length is not small relative to the field-gradient scale, particularly near a streamer head or a sharply enhanced electrode tip.
