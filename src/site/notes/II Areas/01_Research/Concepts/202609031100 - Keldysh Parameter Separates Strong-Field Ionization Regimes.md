# Keldysh Parameter Separates Strong-Field Ionization Regimes

## Core atomic concept

The Keldysh parameter compares the laser frequency with the characteristic tunnelling frequency and indicates whether strong-field seed ionisation is more multiphoton-like or tunnelling-like. It classifies the **initial optical ionisation mechanism**, not the complete gas-breakdown process.

## Mathematical formulation

$$
\gamma_K=\frac{\omega\sqrt{2m_eU_i}}{eE_L},
$$

where $U_i$ is ionisation potential and $E_L$ is optical electric-field amplitude. Since

$$I=\frac{1}{2}n\epsilon_0cE_L^2,$$

$\gamma_K$ can be estimated from measured intensity. The limits are approximately

- $\gamma_K\gg1$: perturbative multiphoton regime;
- $\gamma_K\ll1$: tunnelling regime;
- $\gamma_K\sim1$: crossover requiring a unified rate model.

The minimum photon count is

$$K=\left\lceil\frac{U_i}{h\nu}\right\rceil,$$

and a simplified multiphoton source behaves as $S_{MPI}\propto I^K$. Near threshold, small intensity fluctuations can therefore create large shot-to-shot changes.

## Validity boundary

For nanosecond air breakdown, impurities, aerosols, excited-state pathways and inverse-Bremsstrahlung-driven avalanche can dominate after the first seeds appear. $\gamma_K$ must not be used as a prediction of the electrical breakdown threshold or final electron density.

## Experimental consequences

- Calculate $\gamma_K$ with uncertainty from measured waist, pulse duration and energy.
- Use critically evaluated ionisation energies and state the molecular species/model.
- Compare wavelengths through both photon order and propagation/focusing effects.
- Treat the inferred ionisation regime as a mechanism hypothesis to be tested against channel measurements.
