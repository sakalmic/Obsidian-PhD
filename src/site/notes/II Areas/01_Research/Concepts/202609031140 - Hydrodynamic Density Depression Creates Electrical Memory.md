# Hydrodynamic Density Depression Creates Electrical Memory

## Core atomic concept

Laser energy deposited in air can outlive the free electrons as heat, pressure waves and a low-density channel. At fixed electric field, density reduction increases $E/N$ and can favour delayed breakdown after the luminous plasma has decayed.

## Mathematical formulation

The gas evolves through mass, momentum and energy conservation,

$$
\partial_t\rho+\nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf u)=0,
$$

$$
\rho\frac{D\mathbf u}{Dt}=-\nabla p+\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol\tau,
$$

$$
\rho c_p\frac{DT}{Dt}=\nabla\cdot(k\nabla T)+Q_{laser}+\mathbf J\cdot\mathbf E-\cdots.
$$

After acoustic relaxation, a thermal-diffusion estimate is

$$\tau_{th}\sim\frac{r_c^2}{4D_{th}}.$$

The electrical coupling follows directly:

$$\frac{E}{N(t)}=\frac{E k_BT_g(t)}{p(t)}.$$

Thus a channel may become electrically more favourable even while $n_e$ falls.

## Experimental consequences

- Use interferometry or schlieren imaging if a quantitative density proxy is required; emission alone cannot establish density depression.
- Scan laser-to-HV delay over ns-to-ms ranges with logarithmic spacing.
- Include laser-only and voltage-only controls because electrode current can deepen the channel.
- Check whether the optimum delay follows electron lifetime, acoustic evolution or thermal diffusion.
- Record repetition rate and waiting time to detect cumulative heating.
