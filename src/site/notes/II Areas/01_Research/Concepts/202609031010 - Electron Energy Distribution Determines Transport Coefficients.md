# Electron Energy Distribution Determines Transport Coefficients

## Core atomic concept

Electron-impact rates in air cannot in general be inferred from a gas temperature. The plasma is strongly non-equilibrium: light electrons gain field energy faster than heavy species equilibrate, so the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) determines reaction rates.

## Mathematical formulation

The kinetic description is the Boltzmann equation,

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\mathbf v\cdot\nabla_{\mathbf x}f
-\frac{e\mathbf E}{m_e}\cdot\nabla_{\mathbf v}f=C[f],
$$

where $C[f]$ collects elastic and inelastic collisions. A reaction coefficient for cross-section $\sigma_j$ is

$$
k_j=\langle \sigma_jv\rangle
=\int_0^\infty \sigma_j(\varepsilon)v(\varepsilon)f_\varepsilon(\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon.
$$

The two-term approximation used by BOLSIG+ is appropriate for many swarm calculations but is not automatically valid in highly anisotropic, rapidly changing streamer-head fields. A fluid model then closes particle flux as

$$\boldsymbol\Gamma_e=-\mu_e n_e\mathbf E-D_e\nabla n_e,$$

with coefficients derived consistently from one cross-section set.

## Experimental and modelling consequences

- Store the gas mixture, cross-section database version, solver settings and coefficient tables as model provenance.
- Perform sensitivity analysis across plausible air chemistry/cross-section sets; coefficient uncertainty propagates to inferred channel lifetime.
- Do not impose a Maxwellian EEDF without checking it. A quoted “electron temperature” may be only a convenient energy moment.
- Separate fitted effective coefficients from independently calculated coefficients in the parameter table for CL-05.
