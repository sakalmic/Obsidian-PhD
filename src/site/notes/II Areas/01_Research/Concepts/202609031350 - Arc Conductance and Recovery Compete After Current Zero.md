# Arc Conductance and Recovery Compete After Current Zero

## Core atomic concept

Successful interruption requires arc conductance to decay faster than the recovering circuit can re-establish current, while dielectric strength rises faster than transient recovery voltage. Triggering an auxiliary spark gap can initiate commutation, but it does not by itself prove current interruption.

## Mathematical formulation

The classical Mayr black-box model describes arc conductance $g$ near current zero:

$$
\frac{1}{g}\frac{dg}{dt}=\frac{1}{\tau_M}
\left(\frac{ui}{P_0}-1\right),
$$

where $\tau_M$ is a thermal time constant and $P_0$ effective cooling power. Parameters are fitted effective quantities, not universal gas constants.

After current zero, two inequalities summarize interruption margin:

$$
\left.\frac{dU_{TRV}}{dt}\right|_{0^+}
<\left.\frac{dU_{diel}}{dt}\right|_{0^+},
$$

and the post-arc current/energy must remain below the thermal reignition boundary. The complete circuit determines $U_{TRV}$; the contact/plasma recovery determines $U_{diel}$.

For a commutation capacitor and inductance, a first estimate of injected current is

$$i_c(t)\approx I_c\sin(\omega_ct),\qquad
\omega_c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{L_cC_c}},$$

which must create an adequate artificial current zero in DC or accelerate current zero in an auxiliary branch.

## Evidence needed before an application claim

- measured current zero and post-zero current;
- TRV waveform and rate of rise;
- dielectric recovery/restrike probability;
- complete commutation-circuit energy balance;
- repetitive lifetime and comparison with a defined incumbent switch.
