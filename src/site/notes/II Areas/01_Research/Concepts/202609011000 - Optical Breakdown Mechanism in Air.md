# Optical Breakdown Mechanism in Air

## Core concept
Laser-induced optical breakdown in air is a **probabilistic, condition-dependent transition**, not a universal intensity threshold. Wavelength, pulse duration and spatial quality, focusing geometry, pressure, humidity, impurities, surface proximity and the chosen detection criterion all change the apparent threshold. Values around $10^{10}$-$10^{11}\ \mathrm{W\,cm^{-2}}$ are therefore only an order-of-magnitude planning range for some nanosecond, near-infrared arrangements; the threshold for the present apparatus must be measured and reported with its operational definition and uncertainty.

## Physical mechanism

The useful causal chain is:

1. **Seed generation:** multiphoton/tunnel ionisation, background charge and surfaces may supply initial electrons. Their relative importance depends strongly on pulse duration and local field.
2. **Electron-energy gain and avalanche:** electrons gain energy from the optical and high-voltage fields and create further charge by impact ionisation while attachment and recombination remove it.
3. **Space-charge and streamer growth:** once charge density is sufficient, the self-field changes the applied field and a conductive path can extend beyond the optically ionised volume.
4. **Heating and hydrodynamic memory:** energy deposition lowers gas density on a slower timescale. For femtosecond filaments this density channel can dominate delayed electrical breakdown; that result must not be transferred automatically to nanosecond excitation.

A minimal electron-balance description is:
$$
\frac{dn_e}{dt} = \nu_i n_e - \nu_a n_e - \nu_r n_e^2 - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u}_e n_e - D_e \nabla n_e)
$$
where $\nu_i$ is an effective ionisation frequency, $\nu_a$ attachment, $\nu_r$ recombination, $\mathbf{u}_e$ drift velocity and $D_e$ diffusion. This equation is a bookkeeping model; rate coefficients must be tied to reduced field $E/N$, electron-energy distribution and gas composition before quantitative use.

## Experimental consequences

- Report pulse energy together with spot/channel geometry; pulse energy alone does not determine peak intensity.
- Treat visible emission as a proxy, not a direct measurement of electron density.
- Record failed shots and right-censored delays instead of deleting them.
- Vary focus position and delay because the optically produced channel and the electrically useful channel need not coincide in space or time.
- Use the mechanism-resolved treatment in [[II Areas/01_Research/Concepts/Theory - Laser-Triggered Breakdown and Switching\|Theory - Laser-Triggered Breakdown and Switching]].
