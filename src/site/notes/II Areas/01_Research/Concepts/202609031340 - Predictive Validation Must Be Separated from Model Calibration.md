# Predictive Validation Must Be Separated from Model Calibration

## Core atomic concept

A model calibrated and judged on the same shots measures fit, not predictive validity. CL-03 and CL-05 require an untouched condition, later session or predeclared validation partition that is not used for feature selection, parameter tuning or threshold choice.

## Mathematical criteria

For binary trigger predictions $p_i$, the Brier score is

$$BS=\frac1n\sum_i(p_i-y_i)^2.$$

Calibration asks whether observed frequency matches predicted probability; discrimination asks whether successes receive higher scores. Both are needed. For delay models, use held-out log likelihood, time-dependent calibration and prediction-interval coverage rather than only $R^2$.

Parameter sensitivity can be screened through normalized local derivatives

$$S_j=\frac{x_j}{y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j},$$

and global variance decomposition when interactions/nonlinearity matter. Non-identifiable parameters should be fixed from independent evidence, reparameterised or reported as a set, not hidden behind one best fit.

## Validation hierarchy

1. held-out shots randomly sampled within a session — weakest against drift;
2. held-out operating conditions — tests interpolation/extrapolation;
3. later independent day/electrode state — tests reproducibility;
4. different geometry or laboratory — tests transferability.

## Workflow consequences

- Freeze outcome, metric, tolerance and validation data before opening results.
- Compare the physics-informed model against a simpler empirical baseline.
- Report calibration curves, residual structure and failure regions.
- Preserve a useful negative result: a bounded failure identifies missing physics or insufficient observability.
