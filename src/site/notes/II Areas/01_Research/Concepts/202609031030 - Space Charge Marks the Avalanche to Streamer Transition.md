# Space Charge Marks the Avalanche to Streamer Transition

## Core atomic concept

A streamer begins when the avalanche's own space-charge field is no longer a small perturbation. The ionisation front then propagates through local field enhancement and nonlocal seed production; it is qualitatively different from multiplying electrons in a prescribed field.

## Mathematical formulation

The field must be solved self-consistently:

$$
\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\mathbf E)=\rho=e(n_+-n_e-n_-),
\qquad \mathbf E=-\nabla\phi.
$$

An order-of-magnitude Raether-Meek diagnostic is

$$
K=\int_0^{x_h}\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}}(E/N)\,ds\approx18\text{--}20,
$$

equivalent to roughly $10^8$ avalanche multiplication under idealised conditions. $K$ is not a material constant: geometry, diffusion, background ionisation, attachment and photoionisation change inception.

The fluid continuity system is

$$
\partial_t n_s+\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol\Gamma_s=S_s,
$$

coupled to Poisson's equation. The streamer head has the strongest field and steepest gradients, precisely where local-field and continuum approximations require validation.

## Observable consequences

- ICCD imaging should seek a propagating ionisation front, not merely integrated luminosity.
- Current onset, optical onset and voltage collapse need not coincide; their ordering is evidence for CL-06.
- A reduced model may use $K$ as an inception score but must calibrate its decision threshold on one dataset and validate it elsewhere.
- Streamer diameter and velocity are polarity- and voltage-dependent; spatial resolution must be reported.
