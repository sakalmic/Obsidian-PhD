# Measurement Uncertainty Must Propagate Through Derived Quantities

## Core atomic concept

Quantities such as $I_0$, $E/N$, $k$ and deposited energy are outputs of a measurement model. Their uncertainty depends on all inputs and their covariance; quoting only instrument accuracy is incomplete.

## Mathematical formulation

For $y=f(\mathbf x)$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf\Sigma_x$, first-order propagation is

$$u_c^2(y)=\mathbf J\mathbf\Sigma_x\mathbf J^T,
\qquad J_i=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.$$

For correlated inputs,

$$
u_c^2(y)=\sum_i c_i^2u^2(x_i)+2\sum_{i<j}c_ic_j u(x_i,x_j).
$$

Nonlinear, bounded or non-Gaussian models should use Monte Carlo propagation: sample inputs from justified distributions, evaluate $f$ for every sample and report the output distribution.

## Application examples

- $I_0\propto E_Lw_0^{-2}\tau^{-1}$: waist uncertainty is amplified.
- $E/N=Ek_BT/p$: pressure and temperature covariance can matter within a session.
- $k=U_{app}/U_{50}$: baseline-estimation uncertainty propagates into all treatment comparisons.
- $W=\int u(t)i(t)dt$: timing alignment and probe transfer functions are part of the uncertainty model.

## Workflow consequences

- Maintain an uncertainty budget with source, type, distribution, sensitivity coefficient and correlation.
- Distinguish repeatability, calibration uncertainty, drift and model-form uncertainty.
- Propagate uncertainty into effect estimates and predictive intervals, not only into raw measurements.
- State when uncertainty is bounded but not identified.
