# Statistical and Formative Time Lags Are Different Processes

## Core atomic concept

Breakdown delay can be conceptually decomposed into a random wait for an effective initiating seed and a subsequent growth/propagation time:

$$t_d=t_s+t_f.$$

Laser preionisation can reduce $t_s$, while a spatially favourable ionised or low-density path can reduce $t_f$. The two mechanisms predict different delay-distribution shapes and different responses to laser-to-HV delay.

## Stochastic formulation

If effective seeds arrive as a Poisson process with rate $\lambda_s$, then

$$P(t_s>t)=e^{-\lambda_st},\qquad h_s(t)=\lambda_s.$$

Real data may have time-varying hazard because attachment and density evolve:

$$
h(t\mid\mathbf x)=h_0(t)\exp(\mathbf x^T\boldsymbol\beta).
$$

The formative component can be narrow near high overvoltage but broaden when avalanche, streamer or leader propagation becomes marginal. A mixture of prompt and delayed paths gives multimodality and violates a single-Gaussian jitter model.

## Experimental consequences

- Retain no-breakdown shots as right-censored at the observation-gate limit.
- Plot Kaplan-Meier survival and estimated hazard by condition.
- Test whether laser energy changes the early hazard, the later propagation time, or both.
- Do not claim a microscopic separation of $t_s$ and $t_f$ from one electrical marker alone; use synchronized optical evidence.
