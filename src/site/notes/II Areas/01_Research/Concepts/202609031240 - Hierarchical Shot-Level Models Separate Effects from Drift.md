# Hierarchical Shot-Level Models Separate Effects from Drift

## Core atomic concept

Shots from the same day, electrode pair or alignment state are correlated. Treating them as independent exaggerates effective sample size and can confuse drift with a laser effect. A hierarchical model separates within-block effects from between-block variability.

## Mathematical formulation

For trigger success,

$$
Y_{ij}\sim\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p_{ij}),
$$

$$
\operatorname{logit}p_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1k_{ij}
+\beta_2\log E_{ij}+\beta_3z_{ij}
+\beta_4k_{ij}\log E_{ij}+b_{day,j}+b_{electrode,j},
$$

with random effects such as

$$b_{day,j}\sim\mathcal N(0,\sigma_{day}^2).$$

For delays, the same grouping can enter a survival or accelerated-failure-time model. Random slopes may be needed when the laser effect itself changes across days, but their complexity must be supported by the number of independent blocks.

## Design consequences

- Randomise conditions within safe blocks; do not run every control first and every treatment last.
- Obtain independent days/electrodes, not only more shots within one session.
- Include shot number and shots-since-service to test conditioning trends.
- Report both population-average predictions and block-specific variability.
- Do not estimate many random-effect components from two or three blocks; use simpler fixed blocking or partial pooling with transparent priors.
