# Avalanche Ionization Can Dominate Nanosecond Breakdown

## Core atomic concept

Once seed electrons exist during a sufficiently long laser pulse, collisional energy absorption and impact ionisation can multiply them exponentially. Nanosecond optical breakdown can therefore depend more strongly on seed availability and avalanche gain than on a pure multiphoton threshold.

## Reduced mathematical picture

During the pulse,

$$
\frac{dn_e}{dt}=W_{PI}(I)(N-n_e)+\nu_{av}(I,p)n_e
-\nu_a n_e-\beta n_e^2.
$$

Ignoring depletion and nonlinear losses over a short interval gives

$$
n_e(t)\approx\left[n_{e0}+\int_0^tW_{PI}(t')N
e^{-\int_0^{t'}G(s)ds}\,dt'\right]e^{\int_0^tG(s)ds},
$$

where $G=\nu_{av}-\nu_a$. This exposes two experimentally confounded contributions: the number of seeds and the integrated gain.

The collision frequency affects energy absorption; pressure can increase collision opportunities but also changes focusing, attachment and heat transfer. A monotonic pressure trend is not guaranteed across regimes.

## Experimental consequences

- Threshold data must state pulse duration and probability criterion.
- Test whether adding controlled preionisation changes threshold more than changing peak intensity at constant pulse energy.
- Use shot-resolved pulse energy and channel proxies because exponential gain amplifies input variability.
- Avoid interpreting an empirical wavelength trend as proof of a single microscopic mechanism.
